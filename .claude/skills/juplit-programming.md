# Juplit: Literate Programming Workflow for Python Projects

## What juplit is for

juplit lets you do **literate programming** — writing code alongside explanations, examples, and tests in Jupyter notebook cells — while keeping your repository clean and AI-agent-friendly.

The problem it solves:
- Jupyter `.ipynb` files are JSON blobs: hard to diff in git, noisy in PRs, and token-heavy when AI agents need to read them
- But interactive notebook development is genuinely useful: you can run cells incrementally, see outputs inline, and mix prose with code

**juplit's solution**: `.py` files in jupytext percent format are the source of truth. `.ipynb` files are generated on demand for interactive use and are gitignored. AI agents and humans read `.py` files; Jupyter reads `.ipynb` files.

## File format

Every paired notebook `.py` file starts with a jupytext header:

```python
# ---
# jupyter:
#   jupytext:
#     formats: ipynb,py:percent
#     text_representation:
#       extension: .py
#       format_name: percent
#       format_version: '1.3'
#       jupytext_version: 1.16.0
#   kernelspec:
#     display_name: Python 3
#     language: python
#     name: python3
# ---
```

The key line is `formats: ipynb,py:percent` — this is what marks a file as a paired notebook.

### Cell delimiters

| Syntax | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `# %%` | Code cell |
| `# %% [markdown]` | Markdown cell (content is `#`-prefixed comments) |

### Markdown cells

```python
# %% [markdown]
# # Module Title
#
# Description of what this module does.
```

## Separating logic from tests with `test()`

Import `test` from juplit to gate test code so it runs interactively and under pytest, but **never on import**:

```python
from juplit import test

# %%
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    return a + b

# %%
if test():
    assert add(1, 2) == 3
    assert add(-1, 1) == 0
```

`test()` returns `True` when:
- The module is run as `__main__` (interactive Jupyter cell execution)
- `pytest` is active

It returns `False` on normal import, so test code never runs in production.

## Poe commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `poe sync` | Sync `.py` ↔ `.ipynb` — run after cloning and after editing `.py` files |
| `poe clean` | Sync then delete all `.ipynb` files — use before AI agent sessions |
| `poe init` | Install git pre-commit hooks |
| `poe test` | Run pytest across all `.py` files |
| `poe smoke` | Fast smoke profile (~5s) |
| `poe quick` | Quick profile: smoke + feature (~15s) |

Run via `uv run poe <task>` (or just `poe <task>` if you've activated the venv).

## Workflow

### First-time setup after cloning

```bash
uv sync                # install dependencies into .venv
uv run poe init        # install git hooks (includes juplit sync on commit)
uv run poe nb          # generate .ipynb notebooks from .py files
```

### Editing code (as an AI agent or in an editor)

1. Edit the `.py` file directly
2. Run `uv run poe sync` to propagate changes to `.ipynb`
3. Commit the `.py` file — `.ipynb` is gitignored

### Before handing off to an AI agent

```bash
uv run poe clean       # removes all .ipynb files so agents only see .py files
```

## Creating a new paired notebook file

1. Create a `.py` file with the jupytext header (copy from an existing file in `relann/`)
2. Add cells using `# %%` and `# %% [markdown]` delimiters
3. Run `uv run poe sync` to generate the paired `.ipynb`

Minimal template:

```python
# ---
# jupyter:
#   jupytext:
#     formats: ipynb,py:percent
#     text_representation:
#       extension: .py
#       format_name: percent
#       format_version: '1.3'
#       jupytext_version: 1.16.0
# ---

# %% [markdown]
# # Module Name
#
# Brief description.

# %%
from juplit import test

# %%
def my_function(x):
    return x

# %%
if test():
    assert my_function(1) == 1
```

## Key conventions

- **Edit `.py` files only** — `.ipynb` is generated, never manually edited
- **One logical idea per cell** — keep cells small and focused
- **Gate all test code with `if test():`** — never let test side effects run on import
- **Markdown goes in `# %% [markdown]` cells** using `#`-prefixed comment lines
- **All cells are regular Python** — no nbdev `#|export` or `#|hide` directives. Everything is exported by default.
